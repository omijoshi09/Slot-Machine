After checking require criteria and minum bet range this method will pull_handle method. Pull handle method call the method from column and each time save it in one variable. After that it will stored all the value in array and that is call via show slot method. In show slot method using for loop it will count the every fruit apperance and call the score slot method. In score slot it will check with logic as full house, half house or empty house depending on conditon it will call the method from purse and performs the arithmetic operation."
